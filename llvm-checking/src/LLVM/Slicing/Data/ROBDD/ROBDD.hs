-- | This package implements Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
-- (ROBDDs) in pure Haskell.  ROBDDs provide canonical representations
-- of boolean formulas as directed acyclic graphs and have some very
-- convenient properties:
--
--  * Tests for formula equality are fast
--
--  * The representation is compact for most reasonable formulas
--    due to shared structure
--
-- The performance of ROBDDs is highly-dependent on the order chosen
-- for variables.  In the worst case, an ROBDD can be exponential in
-- the number of variables.  This package does not perform automatic
-- variable reordering, though manual reordering through 'replace' is
-- simple.
--
-- == Performance ==
--
-- This implementation uses pure Haskell and a simple linked
-- representation (as opposed to more-common array-based
-- implementations).  It performs well on reasonable BDDs of 70
-- variables or so; there is still some performance tuning that is
-- possible.  I will make it more efficient in the future.  It is
-- probably not competitive with any of the mainstream BDD
-- implementations, but I have not benchmarked it.  The implementation
-- uses dynamic programming in as many places as possible (except for
-- parts of 'replace', which I haven't figured out how to memoize
-- yet).
--
-- This package makes one significant design decision that sets it
-- apart from many others: BDD nodes are only guaranteed to be unique
-- within their own BDD.  Most other packages that I have seen give
-- uniqueness across all BDDs.  The primary reason for this choice is
-- to allow the RTS garbage collector to collect dead nodes without an
-- additional reference counting mechanism (which seemed very
-- difficult to implement in pure code).
--
-- This means that each BDD is still in canonical form.  There is some
-- sharing between BDDs, but no guarantees about how much.  For
-- example, the result of combining two BDDs via 'apply' can share
-- nodes from either input BDD.
--
-- The downside of this is that equality tests are no longer constant
-- time (tests for tautologies and contradictions still are, though).
-- That said, they are at worst linear in the number of nodes in the
-- BDD (as opposed to exponential for formulas in other formats).
-- However, each BDD maintains its own structural hash.  If two BDDs
-- that are /not/ equal are tested for equality, the test returns
-- False in constant time (since the hashes will not match).
-- Otherwise, the pessimistic test comparing all nodes proceeds as
-- normal.
--
-- The upside is that all BDDs are completely indepdenent and do not
-- share any (mutable) state, so BDD operations can be run in parallel
-- trivially.
--
-- == Notes ==
--
-- This package really needs GHC's @-funbox-strict-fields@ flag (set
-- in the cabal file) to have reasonable memory usage.
--
-- This API is still unstable and subject to change.  In particular,
-- some operations could use better names and 'replace' should return
-- @Maybe ROBDD@ when a rename fails.
--
-- == Examples ==
--
-- deMorgan's Law !(x[1] OR x[2]) == !x[1] AND !x[2]
--
-- >>> let left = neg (makeVar 1 `or` makeVar 2)
-- >>> let right = neg (makeVar 1) `and` neg (makeVar 2)
--
-- >>> right == left
