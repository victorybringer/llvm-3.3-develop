Add an option to *warn* (maybe via a Writer monad?) when dependency
functions without summaries are encountered.  Continue on
conservatively.

See about adding run-time checks in wrappers that take function
pointers as parameters.  If the target is known at runtime to be a
function that does not induce escape behavior, do not cause a leak.
